      <h3>The $WHOAMI bit...</h3>
<p>I’m Chlöe - A enthusiastic Computer and Forensics Student at Leeds Beckett. At the time of writing this post, I am currently about to go on placement year as an interim Penetration Tester for Hedgehog Security. In my spare time I enjoy furthering my skills by undertaking projects, reading and attempting vulnerable machines with my friends. I also enjoy attending security conferences around the UK including BSides London, BSides Manchester and Securi-Tay! I am also a helper outer / organiser for BSides Leeds!</p>

<h3>The how I ended up here bit...</h3>
<p><em>Ok… so… like a lot of people my path into InfoSec is a bit is a bit unconventional…</em> Despite always having a general interest in Computers, when I was younger I had a passion for film and tv editing and always believed I was going to follow a path into media and special effects. However, when I was 18 things changed. I got my first part time job and began hanging around with some somewhat questionable individuals. Sparing you the dark details the TL;DR was that I was very much made to believe that studying at sixth form was a poor choice and instead after 2 years of study, I was influenced to drop out and continue my further education studying on a City and Guilds IT qualification at a local college. Unfortunately for me, the course really didn’t suit me and despite enjoying the course content I ended up exiting the course and taking up full time employment at a bar in my local town. With only 1 A-Level and 3 AS Levels I found myself very stuck and very unhappy. <em>Where things changed…</em> Luckily, my circumstances changed and I was lucky enough to find myself around some amazing people who gave me the confidence and help to turn things around. I applied to study on a few foundation degree courses and shortly after I was enrolled on an ‘Applied Computing’ foundation Degree. After a long year of hard work I then applied for a full degree course at Leeds Beckett and successfully got a place.</p>

<h3>The happily ever after bit...</h3>
<p>Fast forward, I have now recently finished the second year of my course and I am incredibly happy. I have had a number of amazing opportunities including being the secretary for the Leeds Hacking Society (17/18) and being able to help organise BSides Leeds this year.
The InfoSec community is genuinely one of the most accepting and lovely communities going and I am incredibly thankful for all the support I have received since being a part of it. I think the moral of the story here is that no matter your background there is always a way in so don’t give up!
A honourable mention to @LargeCardinal for always telling me to #tryharder and for teaching me some really cool shiz.</p>
